# PlayStore-Analysis-using-python
Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an analysis of the Google Play Store apps to gain insights into app trends, ratings, categories, and other key metrics. The analysis will help identify patterns and provide actionable insights that can be useful for app developers, marketers, and business strategists.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis will be the "Google Play Store Apps" dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle or similar data repositories. The dataset contains various attributes about the apps such as:

1.App Name
2.Category
3.Rating
4.Reviews
5.Size
6.Installs
7.Type (Free/Paid)
8.Price
9.Content Rating
10.Genres
11.Last Updated
12.Current Version
13.Android Version
14.Project Steps
15.Data Collection and Preprocessing

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handle missing values and clean the data.
Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., numerical values for ratings, reviews, installs).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform descriptive statistics to understand the basic properties of the dataset.
Visualize the distribution of key attributes such as ratings, reviews, and installs.
Analyze the relationship between different attributes (e.g., category vs. average rating, price vs. installs).
Data Visualization

Create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent findings.
Visualize the top categories by the number of apps, average rating, and total installs.
Analyze the distribution of free vs. paid apps and their respective ratings and installs.
Identify trends over time by analyzing the 'Last Updated' attribute.
Sentiment Analysis

If review text data is available, perform sentiment analysis on user reviews.
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify review sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
Feature Engineering

Create new features that could be useful for further analysis or modeling.
Examples include app popularity index, weighted rating, or age of the app since the last update.
Predictive Modeling

Build predictive models to forecast app ratings or number of installs based on available features.
Use machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or accuracy.
Insights and Recommendations

Summarize key findings from the analysis.
Provide actionable recommendations for app developers and marketers based on the insights.

Tools and Libraries
Python: Main programming language for the analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
NLTK / SpaCy: For Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis.
Deliverables

Jupyter Notebook: A well-documented notebook containing the entire analysis, visualizations, and findings.
Presentation: A presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, key insights, and recommendations.
Report: A detailed report elaborating on the analysis, models, results, and conclusions.

Potential Challenges
Handling missing or inconsistent data.
Selecting appropriate features for modeling.
Balancing the dataset if there are significant class imbalances (e.g., a large number of apps with no reviews).
Ensuring the sentiment analysis is accurate and meaningful.
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Google Play Store apps dataset, offering valuable insights and predictive capabilities that can benefit various stakeholders in the mobile app ecosystem.
